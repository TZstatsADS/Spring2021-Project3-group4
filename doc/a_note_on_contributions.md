### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

---
Contribution statement: All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.

Pan, Yushi: Presenter. Cross validated and implemented the baseline model. Implemented PCA to the features, chose the best number of principal components, and used those features to implement the LDA model. Used SMOTE technique to deal with the imbalanced data for the XGBoost model. Debugged SVM models with different kernels. Contributed and organized presentation slides. Combined works from group members and organized the main.rmd file.

Xing, Yuqi: constructed Random Forest model(unweight) and Random Forest model with weight, tuning the hyperparameter, cross validation. I participated in every stages of project's discussion and write the README file.

Ai, Haosheng:constructed XGBoost model, testing on different tuning hyperparameters to optimize model. Constructed the test-day file that use to test on test set on the presentation day. Contributed to the presentation slides, main.rmd file.

Shu, Chunyun: constructed K-Nearest Neighbor model, tuning the hyperparameter, performing cross validation and testing, recorded scores from evaluation, in both R and Python. She also ontributed to the presentation slides.

Yuan, Serena: constructed SVM models, probabilistic and non-probabilistic, tuned the parameters, performed cross validation, plotted the linear SVM model, recorded scores from evaluation. Contributed to the presentation slides, participated in all project meetings, helped others with debugging.
